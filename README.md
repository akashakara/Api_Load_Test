### 🚀 Load Tester App
A powerful and user-friendly Load Testing Tool built with Spring Boot (Backend) and React.js (Frontend).
Easily test the performance of any API under load, monitor database behavior, and visualize real-time results with interactive charts.

### 📋 Features
🔥 Custom API Load Testing:
Test any API endpoint by configuring requests per second, total requests, and concurrency.

📊 Real-time Performance Visualization:
Beautiful, dynamic graphs to see response times, success/failure rates, and request throughput.

💾 Database Impact Monitoring:
Monitor how your database performs under load conditions with detailed insights.

🌐 Modern UI & UX:
Clean, intuitive React.js frontend for configuring tests and viewing reports.

🛡 Robust Spring Boot Backend:
High-performance backend to manage heavy concurrent requests, handle analytics, and provide secure API endpoints.

### ⚙ Tech Stack
Backend	Frontend	Database	Others
Spring Boot	React.js	MySQL / MariaDB	Chart.js, Axios

### 💡 Why I Built This
As part of my personal journey to master Spring Boot, React.js, and API performance analysis, I built this project to:

Understand how systems behave under load.

Learn real-world load testing strategies.

Sharpen full-stack development skills.

Prepare for production-ready API stress testing.

### 🚀 Setup & Run
Backend (Spring Boot)

cd loadtester
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Frontend (React.js)

cd load-test-app
npm install
npm start
### 🎯 Future Scope
Add support for distributed load testing.

Export reports to PDF/CSV.

Integrate with popular CI/CD pipelines.

Advanced metrics dashboard (Latency percentiles, error distribution).
